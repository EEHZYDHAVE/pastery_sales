## **Overview**
Predicting Pastry Sales for Smarter Resource Use
In a world where systematic overproduction drives both economic inefficiency and environmental degradation, the challenge of accurate demand forecasting has never been more pressing. This competition invites you to tackle one such real-world scenario: predicting pastry sales. Framed as a time-series forecasting problem, the task calls for innovative yet efficient machine learning solutions to help reduce waste while meeting customer demands.

The dual objectives of reducing waste and satisfying customer demand embody a broader economic challenge. Can businesses achieve resource efficiency without compromising profitability? This competition highlights the power of data science to address these dilemmas, while also hinting at a deeper truth: sustainable change might require not just better prediction models, but a shift in societal values and consumption habits.

## **Description**
The Problem: Pastry Planning and Overproduction
Pastry sales present a particularly intriguing forecasting challenge. Freshness is critical, and unsold items often end up as waste at the end of the day. Overproduction leads to increased costs and environmental harm, while underproduction risks lost revenue and dissatisfied customers. The stakes are high: businesses that master this balance can not only improve their profitability but also contribute to global efforts to reduce food waste.

The Goal: Intelligent Solutions for a Complex Trade-Off
Your mission is to develop models that enable better pastry production planning. By accurately predicting daily and seasonal variations in sales, bakeries can produce just the right amount. However, the solution comes with its own trade-offs. Many state-of-the-art machine learning methods require significant computational resources, raising questions about their sustainability. This competition encourages you to weigh these trade-offs and explore innovative, computationally efficient approaches to forecasting.
